\chapter{Introduction}



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Motivation}

Management of risk in financial institutions in order to maintain solvency. One of the most important types of risk is the market risk, which is the measurable uncertainty associated with changes in the interest rates, exchange rates and financial instruments price values.\newline\newline
Value at Risk(VaR) is the most common way of measuring market risk. It determines the greatest possible loss, assuming an $\alpha$ significance level under a normal market condition at a set time period.\newline\newline
Many VaR estimation methods have been developed in order to reduced uncertainty. It is however of interest to compare these method and determine the prevalence of one VaR estimation approach over others.






%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%



\section{Literature review}

The First papers involving the comparison of VaR methodologies, such as those by Beder (1995, 1996), Hendricks (1996), and
Pritsker (1997), reported that the Historical Simulation performed at least as well as the methodologies developed in the early years, the Parametric approach and the Monte Carlo simulation. These papers conclude that among earlier methods, no approach appeared to perform better than the
others. The evaluation and categorization of models carried out in the work by McAleer, Jimenez-Martin and Perez-Amaral(2009) and Shams and Sina (2014), among others, try to determine the conditions under which certain models predict the best. Researchers compared models in periods of varying volatility-before the crisis and after the crisis (When there was no high volatility and when volatility was high, respectively). However, this confirms that some models have good predictions before the start of the crisis, but their quality reduces with increased volatility. Others are more conservative during periods of low volatility, but in the time of the crisis the number of errors made by these models is relatively low.
\newline\newline
Bao et al.(2006), Consigli(2002) and Danielson(2002), among
others, show that in stable periods, parametric models provide satisfactory results
that become less satisfactory during high volatility periods.  Additional studies that find
evidence in favour of parametric methods are Sarma et al.(2003), who compare
Historical simulation and Parametric methods, and Danielson and Vries(2000) in a
similar comparison that also includes Extreme value theory methods. Chong(2004),
who uses parametric methods to estimate VaR under a Normal distribution and under a
Student’s t-distribution, finds a better performance under Normality. McAleer et al.(2009) showed that RiskMetrics\textsuperscript{TM} was
the best fitted model during a crisis, while Shams and Sina(2014) recognized GARCH(1,1) and GJR-GARCH as well
forecasting models. In contrast to the results obtained
by McAleer et al.(2009), the level of quality of forecasts
generated by the RiskMetrics\textsuperscript{TM} model was considered
unsatisfactory by them. However, attention needs to be
drawn to one difference in the samples, on which the
study was conducted, i.e. the first one comes from a
developed country (USA, S\&P500), and the second one
from a developing country (Iran, TSEM).
\newline\newline

The above indicates that there is no full approval in the evaluation of which models should be used during
periods of calm (low volatility), and which ones during crisis (High volatility).

\section{Thesis Structure}
The next chapter of discusses the properties and basic methods to estimate VaR. Subsequent chapters discuss use of Neural Network in Estimating Value at Risk and numerical comparison of the methods with examples. Findings are summarized in the last chapter.

\section{Concept}
Higher volatility in exchange markets, credit defaults, even endangering countries, and the call for more regulation drastically changed the circumstances in which banks operate. These situations of uncertainty are called risks and managing them is of great importance to financial institutions (e.g Banks) in order to keep them afloat. A possible method of measurement is the evaluation of losses likely to be incurred when the price of the portfolio falls. Value at Risk (VaR) does this.
\newline\newline
According to Jorion (2001), “VaR measure is defined as the worst
expected loss over a given horizon under normal market conditions
at a given level of confidence. For instance, a bank might say that
the daily VaR of its trading portfolio is \$2 million at the 99\%
confidence level. In other words, under normal market conditions,
only 1\% of the time, the daily loss will exceed \$2 million (99\% of the time, their loss will not be more than \$2 million).”
\newline\newline
Mathematically,\newline\newline
Let $r_1, r_2, ..., r_n$ be independently and identically distributed(iid) random variables representing financial returns. Use $F(r)$ to denote the cumulative distribution function,
$F(r) = Pr(r_{t} < r|\Omega_{t-1})$ conditional on the information set $\Omega_{t-1}$ available at time $t$-1. Assume that \{$r_t$\} follows the stochastic process; \newline

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
r_t &= \mu_t + \varepsilon_t =\mu_t \sigma_t + z_t
\\
\varepsilon_t &= \sigma_t  z_t \qquad   z_i \sim (0,1)
\label{1}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

where $\sigma^2_t = E[z^2_t|\Omega_{t-1}]$ and $z_t$ has a conditional distribution function $G(z)$, $G(z) = Pr(z_t < z|\Omega_{t-1})$. The VaR with a given probability $\alpha$ $\epsilon(0,1)$, denoted by VaR($\alpha$), is defined as the $\alpha$ quantile of the probability distribution of financial returns:\newline
$F(\text{VaR}(\alpha))=Pr(r_t < \text{VaR}(\alpha))=\alpha$ or $\text{VaR}(\alpha)$ = inf$\{v|P(r_t \leq v)= \alpha\}$
\newline\newline
One can estimate this quantile in two different ways: (1) inverting the distribution function of financial returns, F(r), and (2)
inverting the distribution function of innovations, with regard to
$G(z)$ the latter, it is also necessary to estimate $\sigma^2_t$.

\begin{equation}
\text{VaR} (\alpha) = F^{-1}(\alpha) = \mu + \sigma_tG^{-1}(\alpha)
\label{2}
\end{equation}

Hence, a VaR model involves the specification of $F(r)$ or $G(r)$. There are several method for these estimations which will be discussed later in this chapter.

\section{Properties}

Fix $\alpha$ $\epsilon$(0,1), then the Value at Risk of a portfolio where the net payoff is modelled by X at a level $\alpha$ is given as:\newline
$\text{VaR}_{\alpha}(X)$ = inf $\{x \epsilon \mathbb{R}| P(X \leq x)=\alpha\}$ has the following properties
\newline

\begin{description}

	\item[$\bullet$] Monotonicity \newline if $X \leq Y$ then $\text{VaR}_{\alpha}(X) \leq \text{VaR}_{\alpha}(Y)$
    \item[$\bullet$] Positive Homogeneity
    \newline $\text{VaR}_{\alpha}(cX) = c\text{VaR}_{\alpha}(X)$
    \item[$\bullet$] Translation invariance
     \newline  $\text{VaR}_{\alpha}(X+c) = \text{VaR}_{\alpha}(X)+c$


\end{description}

\chapter{Hyperlinks and references}
\label{href}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{The package hyperref}

The package \imp{hyperref} is the package for referring to labeled elements of a document and hyperlinks. Now, chapters, sections, equations, figures, tables and other elements can be labeled and referred to, e.g., \autoref{math_fe}, \autoref{math_msymb} and \autoref{href}. These are clickable links which in the pdf redirects the reader to the referred element (with ALT+LEFT you can then go back to where you were reading). Here, different alternatives can be used, e.g., \ref{href}, \autoref{href} or \hyperref[href]{Chapter \ref*{href}}. Depending on which language you have to write something, you may need language options (e.g., ngerman for German hyperlinks).

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Hyperlinks to internet sites, email and attached files}

Hyperlinks can be added as, e.g., \url{http://miktex.org/} or \href{http://miktex.org/}{click me}. Sending an email to a prescribed address can be done by \href{mailto:name.lastname@address.org}{name.lastname@address.org}. If the pdf is delivered within a folder with useful files, these files can be linked in the pdf, e.g., \href{run:attachments/manipulate.nb}{manipulate} or \href{run:attachments/video.mp4}{video}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Literature references}

Bibtex files with literature information can be created either manually or using literature manager programs like \href{http://www.mendeley.com/}{Mendeley} or \href{http://citavi.com/en/index.html}{Citavi}. The bibtex file must be included in the project with \imp{bibliography} pointing to the file, together with \imp{bibliographystyle} and a packages for citing commands. With the commands \imp{cite/p} elements of the included file are then cited, e.g., \cite{Hill1952} and \citep{Kroner1977}. Make sure that while compiling you have chosen a procedure including bibtex (see compiling options). Sometimes it may be necessary to delete all files but not the main.tex file in order to be able to compile again the project, if bibliography styles have been changed.

\chapter{Figures, tables, enumerate and itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Figures}

In almost every document figures will be needed in order to explain a concept or just present something. The package \imp{graphicx} is needed for embedding figures.

\begin{figure}[!h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{figures/cube}
	\caption{A figure caption beneath the figure for description of the depicted concept which sometimes can be very long}
	\label{ft_fig_firstfig}
\end{figure}

In \autoref{ft_fig_firstfig}, for example, a PNG image is depicted (compiled with pdflatex). Alternatively, EPS figures can be embedded if dvips and ps2pdf compilation is used. All figures are listed in the list of figures with the command \imp{listoffigures}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Tables}

Data can be presented in tables, e.g., as shown in \autoref{ft_tab_ex}.

\begin{table}[!h]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{l|cl}
		\hline \hline
		
		& Property 1
		& Property 2\\ \hline
		Criterion 1
		& 764
		& 23546 \\
		Criterion 2
		& 3
		& 34 \\
		\hline \hline
	\end{tabular}
	\caption{Exemplary table}
	\label{ft_tab_ex}
\end{table}

Sometimes very long tables must be presented which may also go over pages. For this cases the packages \imp{longtable} is useful, as used in 

\begin{center}
	\begin{longtable}{l|l|l}
		
		% \baselinestretch{1.5}
		
		\hline \hline
		$i^3$ & $2i^3$ & $3i^3$ \bigstrut \\ \hline

	\end{longtable}
\end{center}

All tables are listed with \imp{listoftables}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Enumerate and itemize}

If important sequential points are to presented the environment \imp{enumerate} can be used as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item
	Some important stuff
	\item
	More stuff
\end{enumerate}
With the package \imp{enumerate} some options can be used, e.g.,
\begin{enumerate}[a)]
	\item
	Some important stuff
	\item
	More stuff
\end{enumerate}
or 
\begin{enumerate}[~~~1)]
	\item
	Some important stuff
	\item
	More stuff
\end{enumerate}

Alternatively, point can be just presented without any enumeration with the environment \imp{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
	\item
	Some important stuff
	\item
	More stuff
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Appendix, footnotes, todos and index}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Appendix}

For many reasons some concept may be important for the document but too long for the main text. In this kind of cases these concept can be presented with the environment \imp{appendix} in appendices, e.g., as in \autoref{app_ex1} and \autoref{app_ex2}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Footnotes}

You may want to give additional information to some points\footnote{Bla bla} in the text\footnote{Blu blup}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Todos}

With the package \imp{todonotes} comments\todo{like this one}\ pointing to their place can be embedded into the text. These comments are veeeery useful if you are writing something for the first time or are working on a draft. The todos can be listed with \imp{listoftodos} where you want it to appear in order to see what is unfinished or needs some more work.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Index}

If the document is very long, it may be very useful for a lot of readers to have an index for searching key words and certain concepts (Crtl+F is usually very helpful in PDFs but not always the best solution). For this, the  package \imp{makeidx}, the commands \imp{makeindex} and \imp{printindex} and the compiling option \imp{make index} are needed. You may want to index different words like heterogeneous materials\index{Heterogeneous materials}, effective properties\index{Effective properties} and homogenization\index{Homogenization}.
