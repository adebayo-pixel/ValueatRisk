\section{Motivation}

Basel I (Basel Accord) is the agreement reached
in 1988 in Basel (Switzerland) by the Basel Committee on Bank
Supervision (BCBS), involving the chairmen of the central banks
of some European countries and
the United States of America. This accord provides recommendations
on banking regulations with regard to credit, market and
operational risks. It aims to ensure that financial institutions
hold enough capital on account to meet obligations and absorb
unexpected losses. \newline\newline
For a financial institution measuring the risk it faces is an essential
task. In the specific case of market risk, a possible method of
measurement is the evaluation of losses likely to be incurred when
the price of the portfolio assets falls. This is what Value at Risk
(VaR) does.\newline\newline
Value at Risk(VaR) is the most common way of measuring market risk. It determines the greatest possible loss, assuming an $\alpha$ significance level under a normal market condition at a set time period.\newline\newline
Many VaR estimation methods have been developed in order to reduced uncertainty. It is however of interest to compare these method and determine the prevalence of one VaR estimation approach over others.






%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%



\section{Literature review}

The first papers involving the comparison of VaR methodologies, such as those by Beder (1995, 1996), Hendricks (1996), and
Pritsker (1997), reported that the Historical Simulation performed at least as well as the methodologies developed in the early years, the Parametric approach and the Monte Carlo simulation. These papers conclude that among earlier methods, no approach appeared to perform better than the
others. The evaluation and categorization of models carried out in the work by McAleer, Jimenez-Martin and Perez-Amaral(2009) and Shams and Sina (2014), among others, try to determine the conditions under which certain models predict the best. Researchers compared models in periods of varying volatility-before the crisis and after the crisis (When there was no high volatility and when volatility was high, respectively). However, this confirms that some models have good predictions before the start of the crisis, but their quality reduces with increased volatility. Others are more conservative during periods of low volatility, but in the time of the crisis the number of errors made by these models is relatively low.
\newline\newline
Bao et al.(2006), Consigli(2002) and Danielson(2002), among
others, show that in stable periods, parametric models provide satisfactory results
that become less satisfactory during high volatility periods.  Additional studies that find
evidence in favour of parametric methods are Sarma et al.(2003), who compare
Historical simulation and Parametric methods, and Danielson and Vries(2000) in a
similar comparison that also includes Extreme value theory methods. Chong(2004),
who uses parametric methods to estimate VaR under a Normal distribution and under a
Student’s t-distribution, finds a better performance under Normality. McAleer et al.(2009) showed that RiskMetrics\textsuperscript{TM} was
the best fitted model during a crisis, while Shams and Sina(2014) recognized GARCH(1,1) and GJR-GARCH as well
forecasting models. In contrast to the results obtained
by McAleer et al.(2009), the level of quality of forecasts
generated by the RiskMetrics\textsuperscript{TM} model was considered
unsatisfactory by them. However, attention needs to be
drawn to one difference in the samples, on which the
study was conducted, i.e. the first one comes from a
developed country (USA, S\&P500), and the second one
from a developing country (Iran, TSEM). Taylor(2020) evaluate Value at Risk using quantile skill score and the conditional autoregressive model outperformed others.
\newline\newline

Attempts have been made to predicts VaR with ANN. VaR estimation on the exchange rate market in the context of ANNs is dealt with in
Locarek-Junge and Prinzler (1999), who illustrate how VaR estimates can be obtained
by using a USD-portfolio. The empirical outcomes demonstrate an evident superiority
of the neural network to other VaR models. Hamid and Iqbal(2004) compared volatility forecasts from neural networks with forecasts of implied volatility from S\&P500 index futures options, using the Barone-Adesi and Whaley (BAW) American futures options pricing model. Forecasts from NN outperformed implied volatility forecasts. Similar results are put forth by He et al.
(2018), who propose an innovative EMD-DBN type of ANN to estimate VaR on the
USD against the AUD, CAD, CHF and the EUR. The authors find positive
performance improvement in the risk estimates, and argue that the utilization of an
EMD-DBN network can identify more optimal ensemble weights and is less sensitive
to noise disruption compared to a FNN. Nevertheless, it is worthwhile to mention that although
foreign exchange volatility forecasting through ANNs have gained some attention in
the academic field, it still remains a fairly undeveloped area.
\newline\newline
All in all, there is no full approval in the evaluation of which models should be used during
periods of calm (low volatility), and which ones during crisis (High volatility).

\section{Concept}
Higher volatility in exchange markets, credit defaults, even endangering countries, and the call for more regulation drastically changed the circumstances in which banks operate. These situations of uncertainty are called risks and managing them is of great importance to financial institutions (e.g Banks) in order to keep them afloat. A possible method of measurement is the evaluation of losses likely to be incurred when the price of the portfolio falls. Value at Risk (VaR) does this.
\newline\newline
According to Jorion (2001), “VaR measure is defined as the worst
expected loss over a given horizon under normal market conditions
at a given level of confidence. For instance, a bank might say that
the daily VaR of its trading portfolio is \$2 million at the 99\%
confidence level. In other words, under normal market conditions,
only 1\% of the time, the daily loss will exceed \$2 million (99\% of the time, their loss will not be more than \$2 million).”
\newline\newline
Mathematically,\newline\newline
Let $r_1, r_2, ..., r_n$ be independently and identically distributed(iid) random variables representing financial returns. Use $F(r)$ to denote the cumulative distribution function,
$F(r) = Pr(r_{t} < r|\Omega_{t-1})$ conditional on the information set $\Omega_{t-1}$ available at time $t$-1. Assume that \{$r_t$\} follows the stochastic process; \newline

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
r_t &= \mu_t + \varepsilon_t =\mu_t \sigma_t + z_t
\\
\varepsilon_t &= \sigma_t  z_t \qquad   z_i \sim (0,1)
\label{1}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

where $\sigma^2_t = E[z^2_t|\Omega_{t-1}]$ and $z_t$ has a conditional distribution function $G(z)$, $G(z) = Pr(z_t < z|\Omega_{t-1})$. The VaR with a given probability $\alpha$ $\epsilon(0,1)$, denoted by VaR($\alpha$), is defined as the $\alpha$ quantile of the probability distribution of financial returns:\newline
$F(\text{VaR}(\alpha))=Pr(r_t < \text{VaR}(\alpha))=\alpha$ or $\text{VaR}(\alpha)$ = inf$\{v|P(r_t \leq v)= \alpha\}$
\newline\newline
One can estimate this quantile in two different ways: (1) inverting the distribution function of financial returns, F(r), and (2)
inverting the distribution function of innovations, with regard to
$G(z)$ the latter, it is also necessary to estimate $\sigma^2_t$.

\begin{equation}
\text{VaR} (\alpha) = F^{-1}(\alpha) = \mu + \sigma_tG^{-1}(\alpha)
\label{2}
\end{equation}

Hence, a VaR model involves the specification of $F(r)$ or $G(r)$. There are several method for these estimations.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%



\section{Value at Risk methods}
The estimation of these functions can be carried out using the
following methods: (1) non-parametric methods; (2) parametric
methods and (3) semi-parametric methods. Below we will describe
the methodologies, which have been developed in each of these
three cases to estimate VaR
\subsection{Non-parametric methods}
The Non-parametric approaches seek to measure a portfolio VaR
without making strong assumptions about returns distribution. The
essence of these approaches is to let data speak for themselves as
much as possible and to use recent returns empirical distribution
– not some assumed theoretical distribution – to estimate VaR.
All Non-parametric approaches are based on the underlying
assumption that the near future will be sufficiently similar to the
recent past for us to be able to use the data from the recent past to
forecast the risk in the near future.
The Non-parametric approaches include (a) Historical Simulation
and (b) Delta-Gamma approximation
\subsubsection{Historical simulation}

The historical simulation involves using past data to predict future. First of all, we
have to identify the market variables that will affect the portfolio. Then, the data
will be collected on the movements in these market variables over a certain time
period. This provides us the alternative scenarios for what can happen between
today and tomorrow. For each scenario, we calculate the changes in the dollar
value of portfolio between today and tomorrow. This defines a probability
distribution for changes in the value of portfolio. For instance, VaR for a portfolio
using 1-day time horizon with 99\% confidence level for 500 days data is nothing
but an estimation of the loss when we are at the fifth-worst daily change.
\newline\newline Basically, historical simulation is extremely different from other type of
simulation in that estimation of a covariance matrix is avoided. Therefore, this approach has simplified the computations especially for the cases of complicated
portfolio.\newline\newline
The core of this approach is the time series of the aggregate portfolio return. More
importantly, this approach can account for fat tails and is not prone to the
accuracy of the model due to being independent of model risk. As this method is
very powerful and intuitive, it is then become the most widely used methods to
compute VaR.

\subsubsection{Delta-Gamma Approximation
}


The delta-gamma approximation (DGA) method is
similar to the delta approximation approach, but
with a higher order of sensitivity. As portfolios in
real life are composed of instruments that are nonlinearly related to the underlying risk factors, the
delta approximation fares poorly due to the linear
assumption involved (as the first order derivative is
nothing but the slope of the curve at a given point).
The natural remedy to this is to incorporate the
next order derivative. The delta-gamma approximation requires the calculation of the second
order derivative, gamma, in addition to the delta
and the returns of each instrument are calculated
as below (derived from the Taylor’s series):\newline\newline
$\Delta(V) = \text{Delta} * \Delta(X) +0.5*\text{Gamma}*\Delta(X)^2$
\begin{description}
	
	\item[$\bullet$] $\Delta(V)$ is the change in the value of the instrument
	 
	\item[$\bullet$] $\Delta(X)$ is the change in the value of the underlying
	\item[$\bullet$] \text{Delta} is the first order derivative of the
	instrument with respect to the underlying.
	\item[$\bullet$] \text{Gamma} is the first order derivative of the
	instrument with respect to the underlying.
	
\end{description}

From the returns computed using the above
formula, the portfolio returns are determined and
the required quantile was chosen as the VaR. The
delta-gamma method works reasonably well for
the simple nonlinear instruments (such as bonds
without put/call options) as the curvature of the
relationship with the underlying risk factor can be
approximated by the convexity measure.


\subsection{Parametric methods}

Parametric approaches assume that portfolio losses follow a pre-determined
distribution, such as a Normal distribution or a Student t-distribution, whereas non-parametric
approaches do not depend on any distributional assumption. Instead, they
approaches focus directly on the underlying loss distribution of a portfolio,
by relying on a sample of observed losses. As a result, these approaches are
applicable to any instrument, while parametric approaches, such as the Normal
distribution, might not be. For example, under normality, the probability loss
distribution is assumed to have no excess kurtosis, however, it has been empirically
observed that financial data indeed exhibits excess kurtosis. Thus, assuming normally
distributed losses when using financial data may lead to incorrect VaR estimates.

\subsection{Semi-parametric methods}
The Semi-parametric methods combine the Non-parametric
approach with the Parametric approach. The most important
Semi-parametric methods are Volatility-weight Historical Simulation,
Filtered Historical Simulation (FHS),the
approach based on Extreme Value Theory and those that directly model the conditional quantile for a chosen probability level using quantile regression, such as conditional autoregressive VaR and . Directly modeling a quantile
avoids the need for a distributional assumption, and allows
the dynamics of the quantiles to differ for each probability
level.

\section{Properties}

Fix $\alpha$ $\epsilon$(0,1), then the Value at Risk of a portfolio where the net payoff is modelled by X at a level $\alpha$ is given as:\newline
$\text{VaR}_{\alpha}(X)$ = inf $\{x \epsilon \mathbb{R}| P(X \leq x)=\alpha\}$ has the following properties
\newline

\begin{description}
	
	\item[$\bullet$] Monotonicity \newline if $X \leq Y$ then $\text{VaR}_{\alpha}(X) \leq \text{VaR}_{\alpha}(Y)$
	\item[$\bullet$] Positive Homogeneity
	\newline $\text{VaR}_{\alpha}(cX) = c\text{VaR}_{\alpha}(X)$
	\item[$\bullet$] Translation invariance
	\newline  $\text{VaR}_{\alpha}(X+c) = \text{VaR}_{\alpha}(X)+c$

\section{The package hyperref}

The package \imp{hyperref} is the package for referring to labeled elements of a document and hyperlinks. Now, chapters, sections, equations, figures, tables and other elements can be labeled and referred to, e.g., \autoref{math_fe}, \autoref{math_msymb} and \autoref{href}. These are clickable links which in the pdf redirects the reader to the referred element (with ALT+LEFT you can then go back to where you were reading). Here, different alternatives can be used, e.g., \ref{href}, \autoref{href} or \hyperref[href]{Chapter \ref*{href}}. Depending on which language you have to write something, you may need language options (e.g., ngerman for German hyperlinks).

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Hyperlinks to internet sites, email and attached files}

Hyperlinks can be added as, e.g., \url{http://miktex.org/} or \href{http://miktex.org/}{click me}. Sending an email to a prescribed address can be done by \href{mailto:name.lastname@address.org}{name.lastname@address.org}. If the pdf is delivered within a folder with useful files, these files can be linked in the pdf, e.g., \href{run:attachments/manipulate.nb}{manipulate} or \href{run:attachments/video.mp4}{video}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Literature references}

Bibtex files with literature information can be created either manually or using literature manager programs like \href{http://www.mendeley.com/}{Mendeley} or \href{http://citavi.com/en/index.html}{Citavi}. The bibtex file must be included in the project with \imp{bibliography} pointing to the file, together with \imp{bibliographystyle} and a packages for citing commands. With the commands \imp{cite/p} elements of the included file are then cited, e.g., \cite{Hill1952} and \citep{Kroner1977}. Make sure that while compiling you have chosen a procedure including bibtex (see compiling options). Sometimes it may be necessary to delete all files but not the main.tex file in order to be able to compile again the project, if bibliography styles have been changed.

\chapter{Figures, tables, enumerate and itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Figures}

In almost every document figures will be needed in order to explain a concept or just present something. The package \imp{graphicx} is needed for embedding figures.

\begin{figure}[!h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{figures/cube}
	\caption{A figure caption beneath the figure for description of the depicted concept which sometimes can be very long}
	\label{ft_fig_firstfig}
\end{figure}

In \autoref{ft_fig_firstfig}, for example, a PNG image is depicted (compiled with pdflatex). Alternatively, EPS figures can be embedded if dvips and ps2pdf compilation is used. All figures are listed in the list of figures with the command \imp{listoffigures}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Tables}

Data can be presented in tables, e.g., as shown in \autoref{ft_tab_ex}.

\begin{table}[!h]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{l|cl}
		\hline \hline
		
		& Property 1
		& Property 2\\ \hline
		Criterion 1
		& 764
		& 23546 \\
		Criterion 2
		& 3
		& 34 \\
		\hline \hline
	\end{tabular}
	\caption{Exemplary table}
	\label{ft_tab_ex}
\end{table}

Sometimes very long tables must be presented which may also go over pages. For this cases the packages \imp{longtable} is useful, as used in 

\begin{center}
	\begin{longtable}{l|l|l}

\section{Enumerate and itemize}

If important sequential points are to presented the environment \imp{enumerate} can be used as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item
	Some important stuff
	\item
	More stuff
\end{enumerate}
With the package \imp{enumerate} some options can be used, e.g.,
\begin{enumerate}[a)]
	\item
	Some important stuff
	\item
	More stuff
\end{enumerate}
or 
\begin{enumerate}[~~~1)]
	\item
	Some important stuff
	\item
	More stuff
\end{enumerate}

Alternatively, point can be just presented without any enumeration with the environment \imp{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
	\item
	Some important stuff
	\item
	More stuff
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Appendix, footnotes, todos and index}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Appendix}

For many reasons some concept may be important for the document but too long for the main text. In this kind of cases these concept can be presented with the environment \imp{appendix} in appendices, e.g., as in \autoref{app_ex1} and \autoref{app_ex2}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Footnotes}

You may want to give additional information to some points\footnote{Bla bla} in the text\footnote{Blu blup}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Todos}

With the package \imp{todonotes} comments\todo{like this one}\ pointing to their place can be embedded into the text. These comments are veeeery useful if you are writing something for the first time or are working on a draft. The todos can be listed with \imp{listoftodos} where you want it to appear in order to see what is unfinished or needs some more work.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Index}

If the document is very long, it may be very useful for a lot of readers to have an index for searching key words and certain concepts (Crtl+F is usually very helpful in PDFs but not always the best solution). For this, the  package \imp{makeidx}, the commands \imp{makeindex} and \imp{printindex} and the compiling option \imp{make index} are needed. You may want to index different words like heterogeneous materials\index{Heterogeneous materials}, effective properties\index{Effective properties} and homogenization\index{Homogenization}.
