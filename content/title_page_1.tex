	\textbf{\LARGE Abstract}\newline\newline
Financial institutions need to have enough capacity to meet their responsibilities and sop up unexpected losses. Since they are exposed to risks, managing them is very important. Several methods have been provided for managing risk, of which Value at Risk (VaR) is the most common for market risk. VaR is a statistical method used to measure the amount of potential loss that could happen in an investment portfolio over a specified period of time under normal market conditions.\\\\ This study compares some VaR estimation methods: Historical simulation, Garch (1,1) model and Long short term memory (LSTM) neural network using the Japan, UK and US stock markets. Each stock market contains 8476 daily log-returns from 05/01/1988 to 30/06/2020. For the Historical simulation and Garch (1,1) model, we use the first 7090 days as our rolling window. As for the LSTM VaR model, the first 7000 daily log-returns (83\% of data) of each series are used for training, 1400 (20\%of data for training) are used for validation while the remaining 1386 are used for testing. From the kupiec test, Historical simulation outperforms other models as it is accepted for both the 95\% and 99\% confidence level. Only the Garch (1,1) model with 95\% confidence level is accepted for all considered stock markets, while that of 99\% is rejected. The LSTM VaR model with 95\% confidence interval is accepted for S\&P 500 (US) and  FTSE 100 (UK), but rejected for NIKKEI 225 (Japan). However, the Kupiec test disapproves the LSTM VaR model with 99\% confidence level for all the three stocks markets.
